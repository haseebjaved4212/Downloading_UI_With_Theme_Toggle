# Downloading UI With Theme Toggle

A small static UI that demonstrates a download-style interface with a light/dark theme toggle.

## Files

- `index.html` — main HTML page and demo UI
- `index.css` — styles including theme variables and layout
- `index.js` — theme toggle behavior and any UI interactions

## Features

- Light / Dark theme toggle
- Simple, easy-to-read markup and CSS variables for quick customization
- Single-file, no build required — works in any modern browser

## Quick start

1. Open the project folder and double-click `index.html`, or open it in your browser:

   - Windows: right-click `index.html` → Open with → choose your browser
   - Or drag-and-drop `index.html` into a browser window

2. Click the theme toggle in the UI to switch between light and dark modes.

## Development

- Edit `index.html`, `index.css`, and `index.js` directly.
- No dependencies or package manager required.

Suggested edits:

- Modify CSS variables in `index.css` to change colors and spacing.
- Extend `index.js` to persist theme choice in localStorage if preferred.

## Accessibility & Notes

- Ensure the toggle is reachable by keyboard (it should be a focusable control in the page).
- Keep color contrast high for readability in both themes.
